# Murphy2019

A one-dimensional individual-based mechanical model of cell movement in heterogeneous tissues and its coarse-grained approximation.
Key algorithms used to generate paper figures.

Murphy2019_GitHub_v1.m is the main script. 
Other functions are called from this. 
Built into the functions is the specific example presented in Supplementary Figure 6 (bell-shaped density, quadratic cell stiffness, linearly increasing resting cell length).
